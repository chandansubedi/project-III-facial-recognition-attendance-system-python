##Facial Recognition Attendance System

This project is a Facial Recognition Attendance System that uses computer vision to mark attendance automatically. It is built using Python and integrates the Haar Cascade Frontal Face Default pre-trained algorithm to detect and recognize faces. The recognized attendance data is saved in a CSV file for easy access and management.

The system features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, making it simple to operate. The application allows users to capture and train photos of individuals, recognize faces in real-time, and mark their attendance. It is designed to streamline attendance management processes, saving time and reducing errors.

This project is ideal for small organizations or educational institutions seeking an automated and efficient attendance solution.
